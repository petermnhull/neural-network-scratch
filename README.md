# neural-network-scratch
An MLP with just maths and no frameworks to remind myself how it works.

Highest accuracy achieved was 86% with just a single hidden layer. Nice.

Latest run with 2 hidden layers was at 85%.

## Notes
- The notebooks need to have the workspace directory as the notebook file root.
